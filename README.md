# KillerWebsite
Hello there!Thought of sharing the code of my first website built!

I included the HTML code of my entire website in the index.html file.

Now I included style.css to control the layout of my webpage,normalize.css that makes browsers render all elements more consistently and inline with more standards and grid.css to set up fluid grid in the basic HTML file.

Then,in order to include various icons in my website I downloaded files such as ionicons.eot, ionicons.min.css,ionicons.svg,ionicons.woff.

In queries.css file media queries to trigger different breakpoints are included.To make sticky navigation work I used a simple jQuery plugin called jquery.waypoints.min.js.In script.js we included some jQuery code for smooth scrolling effect which is taken from csstricks.com code snippets.

Finally,I created a favicon for my website from favicongenerator.net.

I excluded the images used in my website to mention in the repository!
